What is a Master and a Slave?
How does a Kubernetes cluster can be self-healed?


Lets Go:
    A running Node in order to run pods it has 3 main components that need to be installed:
        -Container Runtime
        -Kubelet:
            Kubelet interacts with both the container and the node
            Kubelet is responsible to start the pod with a container inside
        -Kube Proxy:
            Kube Proxy forwards the requests received from the Service

How do you interact with this cluster?
    How to:
        Schedule pod
        Monitor
        re-schedule/restart pod
        join a new Node
    
                                --> MASTER Nodes
    
Master Nodes:
    Master nodes have 4 processes that run on EVERY master node:
