# Kubernetes
My introduction to Kubernetes.
As I am a completely beginner with Kubernetes I will start from scratch, providing all the information that I learn through this repository.
I will upload my code and also every theory that I come across with.
For the introduction on Kubernetes I will use the video below from Techworld with Nana:

Hopefully I will be up to speed in the following months in order to proceed with the certification CKAD.
