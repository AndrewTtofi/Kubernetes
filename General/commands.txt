CRUD commands:
    Deployments:
    Create Deployment:  kubectl create deployment [name]
    Edit Deployment: kubectl edit deployment [name]
    Delete Deployment: kubectl delete deployment [name]

    Pods:
    Create Pod: kubectl create pod pod_name.yml (Need to first create the actual yaml file)
    Delete Pod: kubectl delete pod pod_name
    Edit Pod: kubectl edit pod pod_name (all of the configuration will come up and let us edit MOST of the attributes)
    Edit Pod (2): Alter the yaml file that created the pod then -> kubectl apply -f pod_name.yaml
    
    
Status of different K8S components:
    kubectl get nodes | services | replicaset | deployment

Debugging pods:
    Log to console: kubectl logs [pod name]
    Get Interactive Terminal:   kubectl exec -it [pod name] -- bin/bash
    Get info about pod: kubectl describe pod [pod name]

Use configuration file for CRUD:
    Apply a configuration file: kubectl apply -f [file name]
    Delete with configuration file: kubectl delete -f [file name]
